Thunderbird 68.x Folders and accounts disappeared

If your thunderbird version get automatic upgrade from 60.9.x to 68.2x, it will effected on your account and folder disappeard. To fix this problem, removing the 'global-messages-db.sqlite' file from profile helps Thunderbird to load correctly and the database will get repopulate.

You can find global-messages-db.sqlite in this path.
>/home/user/.thunderbird/xxx.default/global-messages-db.sqlite
